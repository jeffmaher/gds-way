# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The purpose of this style guide is to provide some conventions for working on Java code within GDS. The old [Sun/Oracle Java style guide](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-135089.html) and the more recent [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) are useful starting points.

The more far-reaching _[Java for Small Teams](https://ncrcoe.gitbooks.io/java-for-small-teams/)_ ebook can be read online at no cost. While not free, _Effective Java_ by Joshua Bloch is also an excellent resource. The GDS Library has physical copies of the book.

We generally use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) within GDS. Using it consistently helps when pairing and mob programming. GDS is not able to purchase licences of the commercial editions of IntelliJ IDEA.

We favour consistency across our code, so make sure that you have the agreement of your team when considering using a new or different method or paradigm to those currently in use.

## Code formatting

Variable and field names should match the class they are instantiating, or have a descriptive name reflecting the context of their use.

Always use curly braces around the body of an `if` statement, even if it’s only a single line.

Use the [GDS Way EditorConfig file](editorconfig), which has settings for things like code indentation. Place a copy of this file named `.editorconfig` in the root of your project to have IntelliJ IDEA and some other editors automatically apply the settings. If your editor does not support EditorConfig, manually configure its settings to match.

Some Java teams within GDS have had success using the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) auto-formatter. As a somewhat opinionated code formatter, it may want to make lots of changes if added to an existing project, so you may wish to configure it to match your existing conventions. For a new project, it’s probably easiest to use its default settings.

## Dependency injection (DI)

Consider whether a dependency injection framework is appropriate for your project before using it. Some programmes use the [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) dependency injection framework.

## Imports

You should not use any wildcard imports.  You can configure IntelliJ to explicitly import all classes and static methods in Preferences → Editor → Code Style → Java → Imports with “Class count to use import with *” and “Names count to use static import with *” both set to a very high number, for example, 1000.

The IntelliJ “Optimize Imports” command sorts imports and removes any that are unused. Before committing some changes, you can select all the classes in the modified files pane and then use this command to fix the imports for just the classes you modified.

## Optionals

If a getter may return `null`, you should usually return an `Optional` instead.

You almost never need to use the `isPresent()` method on an `Optional`. Use `ifPresent(…)`, `ifPresentOrElse(…)`, `map(…)` or `flatMap(…)` instead. See DZone Java Zone’s article _[
Optional isPresent() Is Bad for You](https://dzone.com/articles/optional-ispresent-is-bad-for-you)_ for more details.

Optionals work best when used in a functional style, which can take time to learn. The DZone Java Zone article _[
26 Reasons Why Using Optional Correctly Is Not Optional
](https://dzone.com/articles/using-optional-correctly-is-not-optional)_ has some guidance.

## Local variable type inference (the var keyword)

You can use `var` in Java 10 onwards with local variables to have the compiler infer the type. This is especially good when invoking a constructor:

```java
// Java 9
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

// Java 10+
var outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
```

It can also remove duplication where the class name and the variable name are the same:

```java
// Java 9
CheckResponse checkResponse = service.getCheckResponse(...);

// Java 10+
var checkResponse = service.getCheckResponse(...);
```

Be mindful that `var` hides the type of the variable. If the variable name makes the type obvious, this usually isn’t a problem. But if it is not clear from either the variable name or the right-hand side of the assignment, it might be better to explicitly write the type.

The [OpenJDK project has some style guidelines for local variable type inference](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/LVTIstyle.html). Oracle’s [introduction to local variable type inference](https://developer.oracle.com/java/jdk-10-local-variable-type-inference.html) also contains some recommendations.

## Prefer functionality in the Java standard library

Where possible, use functionality from the Java standard library rather than external libraries.

Keep in mind that improvements to the Java standard library mean that some external libraries which were popular in the past now add less value. For example, while Joda-Time was significantly better than the date and time libraries built into older Java versions, the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8 renders it redundant. Similarly, [Google’s Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) is very useful (and recommended) but the unmodifiable collections built in to Java 9 largely remove the need for Guava’s immutable collections.

When using external libraries, favour those which complement the Java standard library. For example, be wary of any library which introduces a new type that replicates the functionality of an existing type in the Java standard library without implementing the same interfaces (for example, a list type which does not implement `java.util.List`).

## Comments
Agree with your team to what extent you permit comments in your code. It’s often possible to [make code more readable so it doesn’t need comments](https://ncrcoe.gitbooks.io/java-for-small-teams/content/style/20_prefer_readable_code_to_comments.html).

## Testing

Use JUnit for unit tests. It can also be used for many integration tests.

The latest [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) is not a drop-in replacement for [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/). The [JUnit Vintage test engine](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4) makes it possible to run JUnit 4 tests within JUnit 5, though not all JUnit 4 features are supported. If you use lots of JUnit 4 rules and alternative runners, or rely on other testing libraries that integrate with JUnit 4, you will have to make more changes. Teams within GDS have found it typically takes a few days to upgrade a project from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. JUnit 4 continues to be maintained.

For new projects, use JUnit 5 unless you have a reason not to.

Use [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for mocking. If you’re still using Mockito 2, upgrading to Mockito 3 should be straightforward because there are no breaking changes.

## Code checking

We encourage the use of static analysis. Static analysis tools for Java include [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/), [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) and [CheckStyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/). However, be aware that such tools can detect an overwhelming number of problems if applied to an existing project, which tends to result in their checks being ignored.

If possible, configure your static analysis tools using configuration files and keep these in your project repositories. This makes your settings more portable and makes it easier to perform the same checks in different places (for example, in a cloud service and on your own computer).

Some cloud-based static analysis tools, including Codacy, can work directly with GitHub repositories. Only grant a tool access to your repositories if it has been approved by an information assurance review.

Try to minimise compiler warnings. If you cannot remove a warning, use an appropriate annotation to suppress it, preferably with a comment explaining why. For example:

```java
public void frobulateFoos() {
    LOGGER.info("Frobulating foos");

    // LibFoo returns a raw list but every element is always a Foo
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    List<Foo> foos = (List<Foo>) fooService.getFoos();

    foos.forEach(foo -> foo.frobulate());
}
```

## Dependencies
Try to keep up to date with the latest versions of your external dependencies. Older dependencies often contain security vulnerabilities. If you wait to upgrade your dependencies, you may find you have to make large version jumps to lots of dependencies at once, which can be painful. Frequent, smaller updates are almost always preferable.

Dependabot (which is part of GitHub) can automatically open pull requests to upgrade your libraries and other dependencies. Be aware that not all dependency upgrades are backwards compatible. Major version upgrades are more likely to cause problems than minor upgrades. Dependabot provides compatibility scores and links to release notes, which can help you make an informed decision. Don’t merge a dependency upgrade unless it passes your automated tests.

Dependabot makes assumptions about version numbers that not all dependencies follow. This can cause it to open pull requests that update to beta versions, release candidates or even alternative variants of the dependency. Always have a human sense-check each Dependabot pull request before merging.

## Build tools

You should use either Gradle or Maven as the build tool. Use recent versions if you can.

## Web frameworks

We use [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/) as our web framework of choice.

Dropwizard 2.0 was released at the end of 2019. There is a [guide for migrating from Dropwizard 1.3.x to 2.0.x](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/wiki/Upgrade-guide-1.3.x-to-2.0.x). Teams within GDS have found the upgrade straightforward.

Dropwizard has built-in support for validating requests with Hibernate Validator. Use [Dropwizard’s validation](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/manual/validation.html) in preference to rolling your own except in cases where Dropwizard’s built-in functionality cannot meet your validation requirements.

If you are sending logs to a service that requires them in a specific format, you may find our [dropwizard-logstash](https://github.com/alphagov/dropwizard-logstash) logging extension useful.

## JDK

The [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) is no longer free for production use. OpenJDK remains free to use (under the GPLv2 with the Classpath Exception) but Oracle only provide general-availability [OpenJDK builds](http://jdk.java.net/) for the latest release.

The [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) project (backed by big names including IBM and Microsoft) provides fully open-source pre-built OpenJDK binaries. For LTS releases (such as Java 8 and Java 11), AdoptOpenJDK have committed to releasing free updates for several years.

In addition, AdoptOpenJDK has benefits such as being available in package repositories, having friendly installers for desktop use, and offering ready-made [Docker images containing OpenJDK](https://hub.docker.com/u/adoptopenjdk).
